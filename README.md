This is a Cas9/gRNA recognition simulation meant to detech viruses and de-select random DNA. 
When a Virus is found, it cuts, there is a % chance that it mis-checks the virus and then cas9 is stuck to the virus for a variable amount of time before it lets go, allowing another cas9 to try.

NOTE:
 . MATLAB code to work must have the python datamine code run first, then a .txt file will generate which then the MATLAB code will use
